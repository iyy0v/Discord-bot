# Discord-bot

A random Discord bot I made for fun ..... and when bored.

## Features
- Delete messages
- Log messages 
- Kick members
- Ban/Unban members

and some other random commands.

## Usage
To host this bot, you will need to have the [Discord.py][discord.py] and [Dotenv][dotenv] modules installed. <br />
If you don't have them already, you can install them using these commands:
```bash
  pip install -U discord.py
  pip install python-dotenv
```
You will also need to create a bot in the [Discord Developers Portal][dds] then get it's client_id and token from there and put them in the **.env** file.

[dotenv]: https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/
