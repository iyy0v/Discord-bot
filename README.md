# Discord-bot (UNFINISHED)

idk what this bot will be yet, I'm just adding more features currently while learning at the same time.

## Features
- Delete messages
- Log messages 
- Kick members
- Ban/Unban members

and some other random commands.

## Usage
To use this bot, you will need to have the [Discord.py][discord.py] module installed. <br />
If you don't have it already, you can install it using this command:
```bash
  pip install -U discord.py
```
You will also need to create a bot in the [Discord Developers Portal][dds] to get it's token and inviting link from there.
